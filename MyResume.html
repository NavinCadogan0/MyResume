            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p><strong>Primary School Teacher (Summer Class)</strong><br>
            Worked as a teacher at a small tutoring and private school, teaching primary school children during a summer class. Subjects taught included low-level mathematics, English, science, social studies, and arts.</p>

            <p><strong>Labourer at Medium-Size Construction Company</strong><br>
            Employed as a labourer at a construction company that frequently contracts with the government. Despite having skills in Information Technology (IT), I worked as a labourer due to the lack of IT positions within the company. I did not possess specialized construction skills such as welding, masonry, carpentry, or heavy-duty machine operation (e.g., excavators, trucks, company cars, and bobcats).</p>
